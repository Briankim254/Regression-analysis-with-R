## Introduction

Regression analysis is a powerful statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. This repository provides a collection of R scripts, examples, and datasets to help you learn and apply various regression techniques in your projects.

## Prerequisites

To get started with this repository, you'll need:

- A basic understanding of regression analysis concepts
- R and RStudio installed on your local machine ([Download R](https://cran.r-project.org/), [Download RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/))

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/Briankim254/Regression-analysis-with-R.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd Regression-analysis-with-R`
3. Open the R scripts and datasets in RStudio
4. Explore the examples and techniques provided, and apply them to your projects

## Included Techniques
